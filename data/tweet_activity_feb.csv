Then there‚Äôs industry pace. 

Slow industries like those that dominated last century (e.g., Metal‚öíÔ∏è, Petroleum üõ¢Ô∏è, Manufacturing ‚öôÔ∏è) can be more specialized. 

Division of labor is clearer. 
Product and market are stable. 
Specialists can go deeper here.","2021-02-10 05:54 +0000","37.0","4.0","0.10810810810810811","0.0","1.0","1.0","0.0","0.0","0.0","2.0","0.0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-"

Young startups may not have the resources to hire both DE and DS. They shouldn't prematurely specialize anyways.

When product and market are influx, fast communicationüó£Ô∏è and iteration cycles ‚ôªÔ∏è are needed.
