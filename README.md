# Twitter Analytics: Project Overview

Exploring Twitter Data

## Motivation

The genesis of this project is to be data-driven in my writing. In one of the office hours for #ship30for30, we learned about two metrics:

1. Media Engagement per Impression: Quality of copy writing / lead-in Tweet.
2. Likes per Media Engagement.

Previously, I examined my Twitter Analytics to look at the correlation between various metrics and Profile Visits.

In a tangential mini-project, I ran a sentiment analysis for my Facebook posts dating back to 2006.

I think this project could be several things:

1. Sentiment Analysis in Python
2. Sentiment Analysis in R
3. Text Mining in R
4. Analytics for Writing Effectiveness
